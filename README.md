## Compatibility

Requires GNOME Shell version 46 and up.

## Installation

### From extensions.gnome.org (Recommended)

The easiest way to install is from the official GNOME Extensions website.

<a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/8671/all-in-one-clipboard/">

</a>

### Installing from a ZIP File

1.  **Download the ZIP:** Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/NiffirgkcaJ/all-in-one-clipboard/releases) page and download the latest `all-in-one-clipboard@NiffirgkcaJ.github.com.zip` file.

2.  **Unzip the File:** Extract the contents of the zip file. This will create a folder with the extension's files inside (like `extension.js`, `metadata.json`, etc.).

3.  **Find the Destination Folder:** The extension needs to be placed in your local extensions directory. You can open it in your file manager or create it if it doesn't exist with this command:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
    ```

4.  **Move and Rename:** Move the unzipped folder into the extensions directory and **rename the folder to match the extension's UUID**. This step is crucial. The UUID is: `all-in-one-clipboard@NiffirgkcaJ.github.com`.

    For example, if you unzipped the files into a folder named `all-in-one-clipboard`, you would run:
    ```bash
    mv all-in-one-clipboard ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/all-in-one-clipboard@NiffirgkcaJ.github.com
    ```

5.  **Restart GNOME Shell:**
    *   On **X11**, press `Alt` + `F2`, type `r` into the dialog, and press `Enter`.
    *   On **Wayland**, you must log out and log back in.

6.  **Enable the Extension:** Open the **Extensions** app (or GNOME Tweaks) and enable "All-in-One Clipboard". You can also do this from the command line:
    ```bash
    gnome-extensions enable all-in-one-clipboard@NiffirgkcaJ.github.com
    ```
